## GEERS - Create ERC-20 token

### Intro

This repo contains a couple of files that work as a placeholder to help you write your own ERC-20 smart contract in Ethereum.

- `/contracts/MyToken.sol`: This is the main smart contract. It contains all the logic.
- `/contracts/IERC20.sol`: This is an interface with some basic functions.
- `/contracts/IERC20Metadata.sol`: This is another interface with some metadata functions.
- `/test/my-token.test.js`: To run your smart contract tests.

### How to use it

The files in this repository are designed to use it on Remix IDE or any other framework/environment you desire.

**Getting started on Remix**

1. Open a new Remix IDE editor at [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Copy the 3 solidity files to `/contracts` directory.
3. Copy the test file to `/tests` directory.
4. Start coding your ERC-20 on `MyToken.sol` file.
5. Test your smart contract running `my-test.test.js`.
